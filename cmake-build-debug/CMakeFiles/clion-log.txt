-- Could NOT find Qt6WebView (missing: Qt6WebView_DIR)
CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  Found package configuration file:

    /usr/lib64/cmake/Qt6/Qt6Config.cmake

  but it set Qt6_FOUND to FALSE so package "Qt6" is considered to be NOT
  FOUND.  Reason given by package:

  Failed to find Qt component "WebView".

  Expected Config file at
  "/usr/lib64/cmake/Qt6WebView/Qt6WebViewConfig.cmake" does NOT exist

  



CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindQuaZip-Qt6.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "QuaZip-Qt6", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "QuaZip-Qt6" with
  any of the following names:

    QuaZip-Qt6Config.cmake
    quazip-qt6-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "QuaZip-Qt6" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "QuaZip-Qt6_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "QuaZip-Qt6" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
